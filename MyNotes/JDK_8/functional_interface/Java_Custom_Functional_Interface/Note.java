    //This page will walk through Java custom functional interface example. Java provides @FunctionalInterface annotation to create functional interface. @FunctionalInterface is available since Java 8. A functional interface has exactly one abstract method. Functional interface can be initialized using lambda expressions, method references, or constructor references. A functional interface can have default methods. Functional interfaces can also be created by inheriting another functional interface. Java provides built-in functional interfaces such as Supplier, Consumer, Predicate etc.
    //Here on this page we will create our custom functional interfaces using @FunctionalInterface annotation. We will create functional interfaces with generics, default methods and by inheritance in our example. We will also provide examples to initialize functional interfaces using lambda expressions, method references, or constructor references. Now let us discuss to create custom functional interfaces step by step.
